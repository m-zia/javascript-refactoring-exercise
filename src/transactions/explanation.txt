-Removed the global variable 'txr' that was on line 2, as it is going to be defined in the processTransactions function anyway.

Inside the processTransactions function:
- added 'let' when defining the 'txr' variable in the processTransactions function
- instead of iterating over the transActions array with a for-loop, we have instead decided to use the for-each method to make the code declarative and more readable
- when converting the txCount object into an array of key-value pairs, we decided to use the Object.entries method instead of Object.keys because it is easier to read and takes up fewer lines of code
